                            Prosper Marketplace, Inc. is a San Francisco, California-based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry.
                            The company operates Prosper.com, a website where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money.
                            It offers unsecured personal loans up to $35,000 at rates that depend on the borrower's credit rating.
                            Each loan is typically funded by multiple people,
                            suggesting a marketplace for loans (for all states except Maine, Iowa, and North Dakota.).
                            They charge borrowers a fee to take out a loan, calling it a <em>closing fee</em>
                            (for most loans the fee is 5% of the loan amount).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The story that this visualization focuses on is the remarkable evolution of Proper Marketplace's portfolio of loans over its first 8 year:
                            Beginning with the <strong>type of loans</strong> that it offered, their value, and their geographic location, the visualization then focuses on the
                            the <strong>pattern of yields</strong> on those loans, in aggregate, (as well as the status of those loans - whether they defaulted or
                            were completed successfully) as the company moved from being a startup to a company that orchestrates
                            hundreds of millions of dollars in loans.

                                                As we have seen, Prosper facilitated a total of &#36;949,894,300 in loans, mainly to refinance debt.
                                                Each loan created has a stated Lender's Yield. In this section, the actual Lender's Yield is estimated.
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                Estimating the actual Lender's Yield implies using only loans that are not current - which totaled &#36;363,719,700.
                                                As can be seen in the companion <em>Loan Status</em> visualization, this means that the estimated yield for more recent years is based
                                                on a smaller and smaller proportion of loans (and so cannot be considered to be a true reflection of the yield for the
                                                relevant portfolio of loans displayed for those years). This is the reason for the shaded region in the main visualization, which represents years
                                                for which complete loans are less than 50&#37; of total loans. The <em>Loan Status</em> visualization also highlights that the
                                                relative proportion of completed to defaulted loans closely tracks the estimated yield.

                                                Customer payments, for loans that were not current, were &#36;335,204,900, which suggests a gross
                                                (non-annualized) return of -7.84&#37; (or -3.97&#37; when recovery is included). Pre-2009, including recovery,
                                                there was a gross return of -5.73&#37; (on &#36;178,560,500 of loans).
